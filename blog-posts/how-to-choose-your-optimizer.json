    "description": "Variational hybrid algorithms often task a quantum processor to prepare, parametrically, a quantum state and a classical computer to optimize these parameters. Whether you are looking for the ground state of a molecule or training a quantum neural network this how-to will guide you through the choice of the most convenient optimizer featured in PennyLane.",
