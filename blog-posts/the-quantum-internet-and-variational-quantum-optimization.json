    "description": "We discuss how hybrid algorithms can help the design of quantum communication networks. To demonstrate, we share recent results from a collaboration between Xanadu and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in which we show that variational quantum optimization can find maximally nonlocal correlations in noisy quantum networks.",
