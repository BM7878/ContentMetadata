    "description": "Near-term quantum devices are noisy, a fact we need to account for in our simulations. In this how-to guide, we give three simple methods for simulating noise: classical jitter, built-in PennyLane support for mixed states and quantum channels, and finally plugins to Cirq and Qiskit.",
